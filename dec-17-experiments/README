These experiments were done using a closed model. 
The file names are as follows:
	read_<FTL_NUM>_<WRITE_ENABLED>_<SSD_UTIL>_<NUM_R/W_THREADS>.out
	FTL_NUM is the FTL being used
	WRITE_ENABLED is whether it is a read write workload or simply a read only workload
	SSD_UTIL is the capacity of SSD filled up before starting the experiments
	NUM_R/W_THREADS is the num of threads that do read (if write enabled, then an equal num of threads do writes)
		This dictates the number of concurrent outstanding requests on the SSD at any point of time
	The source for these experiments is make_test_queued.cpp

	The data file contains the read latency percentile (generated from latencies.py scripts)
